# **Project Brief**
### **Aidan Robertson      -     Monday April 25th 2022**
## **Objectives:**  
  **Analysis**

* What is the aproximate probability distribution between the test group and the control group
* Is a user that must call-in to cancel more likely to generate at least 1 addition REBILL?
* Is a user that must call-in to cancel more likely to generate more revenues?
* Is a user that must call-in more likely to produce a higher chargeback rate(CHARGEBACKs/REBILLs)?
 
 **Visualization**
* Analysis must be coded in R or Python
* Analysis must be submitted to a github repository
* Analysis must be written in markdown format
* Please include at least 1 vizualization with your analysis
* Please use statistical significance tools to answer the questions we've asked
* Include the code you used to perform the analysis in the github repository
* Send us the link to your repository once you've completed the analysis

## **Current State:**

* The table testsamples.csv consisted of 59721 rows and 2 columns indicating the the sample id and test group. The table transdata.csv consisted of 7430 rows and 4 columns indicating the transaction id, sample id, transaction type and transaction amount. While looking for errors in the data no duplicate values or rows were found as well as zero Nan or null values were identified. It seems little to no data cleaning was required.

## **Data Preparation:**


## **Feature Engineering:**

## **Visualizations, Conclusions & Aggregations:**
### Question 1: What is the aproximate probability distribution between the test group and the control group?

### Question 2: Is a user that must call-in to cancel more likely to generate at least 1 addition REBILL?

### Question 3:Is a user that must call-in to cancel more likely to generate more revenues?

### Question 4:Is a user that must call-in more likely to produce a higher chargeback rate(CHARGEBACKs/REBILLs)?
